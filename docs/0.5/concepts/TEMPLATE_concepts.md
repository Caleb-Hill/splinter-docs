# Title: Name of Concept

<!--
Note: The file name should match the title, with underscores instead of spaces
and no caps, such as connection_manager.md or biome.md.)
-->

<!--
Start the topic with a high-level description that you could put on a
presentation slide or three, but with full sentences and paragraphs instead of
bullets. Include the following information as appropriate:
- What is {concept}?
- Why does {concept} exist?
- How does {concept} fit into Splinter?
- What does {concept} use or require?
- What (or who) uses {concept}?
-->

<!--
Add at least one picture or diagram that illustrates the concept, followed by
any necessary explanation (optional, if already explained above).

 1. Put the image file in ./assets/{concept}.png

 2. Use in-line Markdown syntax to include the image in this topic:

    ![alt_text_for_hovering](../assets/name.png) "Image title"
-->

<center>
![Placeholder image](../assets/TEMPLATE_placeholder_image.png)
</center>

## Descriptive Heading (Optional)

<!--
For a long topic, add sub-headings liberally to break up blocks of text. In the
text, use lists (bulleted list by default; use numbered lists only for steps or
items that must occur in order).
-->

## Relationship with Other Components

<!--
Describe the concept's relationships with other items (such as each item in
"What (or who) uses {concept}?"). For example, in the connection manager topic,
explain its relationship with the peering manager.

If the explanation gets too long, include a summary in this topic and move the
details into the other item's concept topic. Then link each topic to the other.
-->

## Other Heading (Like "About {Concept}" or "Understanding {Concept}")

<!--
Describe any externally visible behavior and explain what matters to others,
such as endpoints,  feature flags, configuration options, CLI commands, gotchas
that could cause problems, etc. Explain when and why someone (or something)
would see the behavior or would need to know this information.
-->

## For More Information

<!--
Add links to related topics (concepts, how-to topics, reference topics, etc.)
in a bulleted list.
