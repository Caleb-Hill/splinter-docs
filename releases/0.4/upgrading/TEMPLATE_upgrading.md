List the changes that will be walked through in this document
-->

## Change 1
Start with a description of what is being asked of the “upgrader”. Put enough
information so they can decide if they need to investigate further.

"This is what you need to replace" is the core idea of the upgrade instructions.
The instructions should provide the steps that an upgrader needs to take to
properly update their custom code or environment for running the new version of
Splinter.

At the end of each section include any further links that may be useful while
upgrading.
