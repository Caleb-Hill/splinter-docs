The Splinter ecosystem includes a variety of published artifacts, including
Docker images and Rust crates for the Splinter libraries. All Splinter artifacts
are versioned together; this means that for each release, a new version of each
artifact will be published with the new release number. This allows developers
to easily select compatible versions of all crates and images.

Below is a list of all major artifacts that are published with every Splinter
release.
