# Release Versioning

Splinter follows a pattern of alternating stable and development versions. Every
even-numbered minor version (like 0.4) is a stable release, and every
odd-numbered minor version (like 0.3 or 0.5) is a development release. The
latest development release, when deemed complete by the team, will become the
next stable release.

The latest stable release should be the default choice for most use cases. Patch
releases will be provided, but breaking changes will not be introduced in any
patch releases.

The latest development release may be used when cutting-edge features are
desired, but should be used with caution. Patches will be released regularly,
and breaking changes are likely to be introduced due to rapid development.
