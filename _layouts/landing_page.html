                    Splinter is a privacy-focused platform for distributed
                    applications that provides a blockchain-inspired networking
                    environment for private communication and transactions
                    between organizations.

                                    Splinter’s advanced privacy features are based on circuits, which create
                                    distributed privacy domains within the larger Splinter network. Circuits are
                                    fully distributed without compromise — no centralized nodes or administration.

                                    Splinter’s architecture supports running multiple distributed ledgers. The
                                    default ledger, Scabbard, executes WebAssembly smart contracts with Hyperledger
                                    Transact and Hyperledger Sawtooth Sabre.

                                    No single distributed ledger works for all use cases, so Splinter provides a
                                    modular platform that can run multiple distributed ledgers. You can design the
                                    architecture you need, then build your solution by assembling the right pieces.
